# UFront Portfolio

## Introduction
There is some [great example code](https://github.com/kevinresol/ufront-nodejs-guide) made by @kevinresol which is dedicated to the NodeJS target. I built [my own company site](http://confidant.ca] for the PHP target with assistance from him and @postite. By offering this source code with a working real-world application I hope that it will make it easier for other Haxe developers to jump into using [UFront](https://github.com/ufront). 

## Why Use UFront?
* You will have the same code base on both client and server.
* It's super fast. Correctly configured, the framework will cache resources and build pages client-side, remotely loading only the data required to build the page.
* The MVC code structure makes it easy to separate your content from your other code.
* Multiple templating systems are available. I am using the default Haxe template system.
