<h3>Treacherous Book Cover</h3>
<p>Winner of Saskatchewan’s Premier’s Award of Excellence in Graphic Design (2009). This book is the account of an RCMP agent among the Hells Angels. I named the book and desiged it to communicate the author’s desperation and to give a sense of his dangerous situation and lifestyle.</p>

<h3>Ajax and Me</h3>
<p>Ajax and Me is a glimpse into the lives of “boys being boys” and a fast-paced tale of adventure and misadventure written by a Métis author. I designed the cover and did ink illustrations for each chapter.</p>

<h3>How to Call a Moose</h3>
<p>This is Andrew Fehr’s first collection of hilarious short stories about hunting and fishing. The cover needed to tell at a glance what sort of humour the reader could expect.</p>

<h3>Inside a Police Informant’s Mind</h3>
<p>This book serves as an honest account of the role, risks, and motives of police informants. The cover clearly communicates how the book addresses the relationship between agents and their handlers.</p>
