<p>Try to input something and click submit, the "GET" request will not be sent to server, 
<br/>because it is handled by pushstate. Instead, the client will handle the request and, 
<br/>for the API call it will use remoting so that the API call is actually run on the server.
<br/>You can check the server output to verify that.</p>

<form class="pushstate" method="GET">
	<input name="param" />
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
